# Securing Your Linux Server

Securing your Linux server is crucial to protect sensitive data and maintain system integrity. Start by keeping your system updated with the latest security patches. Use SSH keys instead of passwords for remote access, and disable root login to minimize risk. Implement a firewall such as UFW or iptables to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Regularly audit your system with tools like Lynis to identify vulnerabilities, and ensure proper file permissions and ownerships are in place to restrict unauthorized access. Back up your data consistently to safeguard against potential threats or system failures.
